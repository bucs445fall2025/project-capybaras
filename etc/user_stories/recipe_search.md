# Recipe Search

## **User Story**
As a user,
I want to search for recipes by name, ingredient, or category,
so that I can quickly find recipes that match what I want to cook.

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- Users can type a recipe name or keyword into a search bar.
- Search results display recipe names, images, and brief descriptions.
- Search results update dynamically or upon clicking a search button.
- Clicking a recipe opens a full recipe detail page.

## **Notes**
- Search functionality may use a public recipe API
