# Scalable Storage

## **User Story**
As a user,
I want the storage to be adjustable as more recipes are added.

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- The system can store scalable number of recipes.
- Users can add new recipes without errors, even as the database grows.
- Users can access all saved recipes reliably, regardless of database size.

## **Notes**
- Consider using a database that scales easily, e.g. MongoDB or PostgreSQL
