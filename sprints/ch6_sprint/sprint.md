### The summary of the entire project

Creating a recipe website where users can search for, browse, and save recipes in a visually engaging and user-friendly way. The platform allows users to browse a grid of recipe ideas, with images and recipe titles. Additionally, users can save recipes for easy access later and search/filter for specific recipes.

## Sprint 6 Planning

## Requirements Flex

5/5 requirement flexes remaining

## Technical Debt

n/a

### Requirement Target

- Search functionality
- Save recipes to folders & likes function

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to search for specific recipes by name to meet my preferences. 
- As a user, I want to save recipes that I like/want to try so I can find it again easier later.
- As a user, I want to be able to mark recipes as likes to easily save them into the likes folder. 

### Planning

- When a user searches for a specific recipe, related search results come up. Create a like button and save button on homepage and on recipe details page. Have the collections page update based on user actions. 

### Action Items

- Implement the search bar functionality using dummy variables.
- "Like" Button: A heart icon that changes state (filled) upon clicking.
- "Save" Button: A button that triggers a dropdown for folder selection.
- Collections Page: Update collections page based on user actions
- Testing & Review

### Issues and Risks

### Team Work Assignments
