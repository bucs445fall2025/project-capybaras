# **Project Overview**

## **Application Vision/Goal:**
[Describe the overall purpose and vision of the application. What problem does it solve? Who is the target audience?]
The purpose of our application is to have all the recipes in one place. Some problems it would solve includes saving a recipe from a random site but never actually going back to looking at it, the user forgetting they used/the recipe getting lost among all the other recipe sites, and just have everything in one place. Target audience would be people who enjoy cooking and those who have a hard time deciding what's for dinner.

## **Scope:**
[List the major features and functionalities that define the scope of the project. Keep this high-level to avoid feature creep.]
Users can easily look up and save new recipes, while also uploading their own creations. 
We would have a "for you" page that would give recipe suggestions for users based on ones that they have liked/saved. 
Users can also save them into folders. 
Calendar feature for easy meal planning. 

## **Deliverables:**
[List what will be delivered by the end of the project, such as a working MVP (Minimum Viable Product), specific features, documentation, etc.]
Working MVP. We would have a working website that gives users some of the features and functionalities mentioned above. 

## **Success Criteria:**
[Define what will make this project successful. Examples include meeting deadlines, delivering core functionality, or achieving performance benchmarks.]


## **Assumptions:**
