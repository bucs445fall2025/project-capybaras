# **Project Overview**

## **Application Vision/Goal:**
The purpose of our application is to have all the recipes in one place. Some problems it would solve includes saving a recipe from a random site but never actually going back to looking at it, the user forgetting they used/the recipe getting lost among all the other recipe sites, and just have everything in one place. Target audience would be people who enjoy cooking and those who have a hard time deciding what's for dinner.

## **Scope:**
- Users can easily look up and save new recipes, while also uploading their own creations. 
- Have a "for you" page that would give recipe suggestions for users based on ones that they have liked/saved. 
- Users can save recipes into folders. 
- Calendar feature for easy meal planning. 

## **Deliverables:**
Working MVP. We would have a working website that gives users some of the features and functionalities mentioned in the project scope. 

## **Success Criteria:**
To make this project successful, we would make sure to meet each milestones, maintain clear communication with each team members, and deliver all core functionality mentioned in the project scope. 

## **Assumptions:**
- Users will primarily access the application via desktop and mobile web browsers.
- Third-party libraries or APIs used will remain stable and supported.
- The tech stack will remain consistent throughout development. 
- All team members will become familiar with the chosen frameworks and tools.


## **Risks:**
- Integrating APIs for recipe data. 
- Unfamiliarity with the tech stack and frontend/backend creating process. 

## **Design / Architectural Review:**
- Monolithic 
- Database used: TBD
- Major components include a frontend that handles user interaction and a backend that handles API requests and communication with the database. 

## **Test Environment:**
We will probably manually test each feature implemented to catch the bugs... TBD
