## Sprint Review

### SRS Sections Updated

- Team
- Functional and non-functional requirements 

### User Story

- As a user, I want to search for specific recipes by name to meet my preferences.
- As a user, I want to save recipes that I like/want to try so I can find it again easier later. 
- As a user, I want the storage to be adjustable as more recipes are added.

### Sprint Requirements Attempted

In the last sprint, we filled out the functional and non-functional requirements in the SRS. 

### Completed Requirements

- Set up front end and back end dockerfile
- Chose the stacks for this project 

### Incomplete Requirements

We have set up the docker environment for both the front end and back end. However, we are not sure if we have set them up correctly since none of us had any previous experience with using docker. 

### The summary of the entire project

Creating a website that allows users to save and search for recipes.
