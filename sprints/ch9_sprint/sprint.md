As a user, I want to be able to mark recipes as likes to easily save them into the likes folder. 

### Planning

- Extend the backend with new API routes to manage folders (create, read, update, delete).
- Ensure likes and saved recipes persist across sessions by fetching folder and recipe data from the backend on app load.

### Action Items

- Build backend folder routes (/folders) with CRUD functionality.
- Implement frontend API service functions for folders (fetch, create, update, delete).
- Connect frontend save/like actions to update backend data.

### Issues and Risks

Busy class schedule and assignment workload. We will allocate certain time frame to work on this project.

### Team Work Assignments

We will work on action items together.
